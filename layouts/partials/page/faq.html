                        <div class="cd-faq-content">
                            <p>Beard balm is a men's grooming product used to condition and hold facial hair. Our products come in various consistencies (light and medium hold and wax), as well as manly scents.</p>

                        <div class="cd-faq-content">
                            <p>This is a matter of personal preference, style, and length of facial hair. Both can be used interchangeably for conditioning and adding fragrance and can be applied to all sorts and styles of facial hair. Balms offer an added value of providing a "hold" to your hair.</p>

                            <p>Another personal preference topic. We prefer combs as brushes tend to create more static and tangles. Boars hair brushes are best for the hair and wooden combs reduce or eliminate static electricity in our experience.</p>

                        <div class="cd-faq-content">
                            <p>Scoop a pea sized amount of balm from the tin with the tip of your finger. Rub the balm between your hands to melt the balm to an oil consistency. Using your hands and fingers, massage the balm into your beard starting at your skin and working it through your entire beard. Use a comb or brush to shape.</p>

                        <div class="cd-faq-content">
                            <p>Our balms use all natural ingredients including shea butter, coconut oil, and beeswax. The fragrances are derived from essential oils. Our shampoo bars are made using "mostly" natural ingredients as lye (sodium hydroxide) is not a naturally occurring ingredient but necessary in handcrafted soap making. Our oils use coconut oil as a carrier with essential oils added for fragrance.</p>

                        <div class="cd-faq-content">
                            <p>The average shelf life of all of our products are 6 months or more. Actual usage varies and is dependent upon how often the product is used (daily vs. weekly) and the size of your beard or facial hair. Our shampoo bars have replaced bottled shampoo in our home and will typically last at least a month with daily usage (both beard and head hair). The 1 ounce beard balm will last about a month as well with daily usage on average facial hair.</p>
